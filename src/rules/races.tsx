        Races that include killing a boss need to be completed deathless. This
        means your character can't die during the boss fight, but you are
        allowed to die anytime beforehand.

        Item, delve and pantheon bounties are tracked automatically and do not
        need to be submitted manually. It is still advised to take a screenshot
        of your completion in case there are disputes as the tracking can be off
        about a minute.

        The endless chase race can be submitted multiple times per team with
        different numbers of Timeless Jewels dropped. If two teams have the same
        amount of jewels dropped, the team that submitted first will get more
        points.
