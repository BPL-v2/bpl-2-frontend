      <p>
        Each challenge must be completed by a different base-class based
        ascendancy (19). Each challenge completed earns 1 bronze medal.
        Completing 6 of the challenges means a 1 silver medal, completing all
        challenges earns a gold medal. If you have multiple players for a
        challenge, they must all be using the same ascendancy. Any bloodline
        ascendancies may be used, but at least 1 passive must be used from a
        base-class based ascendancy.
